    "text": "I’m an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics in the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University.\nMy research focuses mostly on causal inference: developing statistical methods and machine learning tools to support inference about the consequences of (e.g) medical decisions, environmental & social exposures, and policies. Current research topics include structure learning (a.k.a. causal discovery or causal model selection), semiparametric inference, longitudinal analysis, and missing data. I also work on algorithmic fairness: understanding and counteracting the biases introduced by data science tools deployed in socially-impactful settings, especially healthcare. Finally, I have interests in the philosophy of science and the foundations of statistics.\nPreviously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Johns Hopkins University. I completed my PhD at Carnegie Mellon University in 2017 and earned my BA from Columbia University in 2011.\nMy CV is available here.\nContact: d.malinsky {at} columbia.edu"
